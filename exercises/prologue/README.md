# Prologue Take Aways
The book says the only limit to nesting is your own patients. Mine wears out
pretty quickly. By the last few revisions to the `picture-of-rocket` function
I was splitting stuff up into `(define foo)` statements that easily fit on a
single line. Then the prologue ends on that general idea.

I'm still not used to conceptualizing programs as algebraic. And the Polish
notation style of Racket feels unnatural yet. *But* somehow it is easier for me
to wrap my head around `define`d statements as substitution, in an algebraic
sense, while writing this code. I can sometimes sorta see that when reading
Haskell, as well. And I guess I could eventually get there with stuff like
Javascript arrow functions. Some day.

I realize the point of the prologue was largely playful coding. But I'm looking
forward to getting into the "systematic program design" process from here on
out.
